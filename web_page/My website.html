<h4><a id="swimming"></a>Why swimming is so important?</h4>
<p class="suur">Swimming is one of the most popular sports in Australia.
   Our nation is surrounded by water and swimming is one of our great passions.
   As well as being fun, swimming is a great way to keep fit, stay healthy and make friends.
   Swimming is a healthy activity that you can continue for a lifetime.
   It is a low-impact activity that has many physical and mental health benefits.
   Swimming is a great workout because you need to move your whole body against the resistance of the water.
   <span> Swimming is a good all-round activity because it:
   keeps your heart rate up but takes some of the impact stress off your body
   builds endurance, muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness
   helps you maintain a healthy weight, healthy heart and lungs
   tones muscles and builds strength
      provides an all-over body workout, as nearly all of your muscles are used during swimming.</span></p>
<h4><a id="Michael Phelps"></a>Who is Michael Phelps and why is he my idol?</h4>
<p class="suur">He is the most successful and most decorated Olympian of all time <span> with a total of 28 medals.</span>
   Phelps also holds the all-time records for Olympic gold medals, Olympic gold medals in individual events, and Olympic medals in individual events.
   When Phelps won eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games, he broke fellow American swimmer Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven first-place finishes at any single Olympic Games.
   At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Phelps already tied the record of eight medals of any color at a single Games by winning six gold and two bronze medals.
   At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps won four gold and two silver medals, and at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he won five gold medals and one silver.
   <span> This made him the most successful athlete of the Games for the fourth Olympics in a row.</span></p>
